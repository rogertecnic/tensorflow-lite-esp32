# TensorFlow-Lite and Platform.io

This repo demonstrates how to use a TensorFlow model on the ESP32 using Platform.io.

There's a walkthrough video here: https://youtu.be/kZdIO82059E

## Setup

To train the model you'll need a python environment. Make sure you have python 3 installed on your system:

```
python3 --version
```

Then run the following command to create a virtual python environment.

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the environment using:

```
. ./venv/bin/activate
```

And install the dependencies using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training the model

Make sure you have activated the virtual environment using:

```
. ./venv/bin/activate
```

Then run:

```
jupyter notebook .
```

Open up the `train_model` notebook and follow the instructions in the notebook.

Once you've trained and converted the model run:

```
xxd -i converted_model.tflite > firmware/src/model_data.cc
```

You can then open up the platform.io project in `firmware` folder and try it out.
